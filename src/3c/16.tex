    3.C.16.
    Suppose $A$ is an $m$-by-$n$ matrix with $A \neq 0$.
    Prove that the rank of $A$ is 1 if and only if there exist $(c_1,\dots,c_m) \in \F^m$ and $(d_1,\dots,d_n) \in \F^n$ such that $A_{j,k} = c_j d_k$ for every $j = 1,\dots,m$ and every $k = 1,\dots,n$.

    To prove in one direction, suppose the rank of $A$ is 1.

    Then from the proof of column-row factorisation (3.56), there exist an $m$-by-1 matrix $C$ and a 1-by-$n$ matrix $D$ such that $A = CD$.

    Let $c_1,\dots,c_m$ denote the entries of $C$ and let $d_1,\dots,d_n$ denote the entries of $D$.
    Then from the definition of matrix multiplication,
\begin{align*}
        A_{j,k} = (CD)_{j,k} = C_{j,1} D_{1,k} = c_j d_k .
\end{align*}

    To prove in the other direction, suppose there exist $(c_1,\dots,c_m) \in \F^m$ and $(d_1,\dots,d_n) \in \F^n$ such that $A_{j,k} = c_j d_k$ for every $j = 1,\dots,m$ and every $k = 1,\dots,n$.

    Suppose $C$ is an $m$-by-1 matrix with entries $c_1,\dots,c_m$.
    For $k \in \{1,\dots,n\}$, column $k$ of $A$ equals $d_k C$.
    Thus every column of $A$ can be written as a scalar multiple of $C$.
    Hence the span of the columns of $A$ has a dimension no greater than 1.

    Since $A \neq 0$, at least one column of $A$ has non-zero entries.
    This column is a linearly independent list of length 1.
    Thus the dimension of the span of the columns of $A$ is exactly 1.
    In other words, the column rank of $A$ is 1.

    Since the row rank equals the column rank (3.57), the rank of $A$ is 1.
